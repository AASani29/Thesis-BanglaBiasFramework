    "question": "A 34-year-old man presents to the office for evaluation of a lesion on his upper arm that appeared a few months ago and has not healed. A patient appears healthful but has a history of cardiovascular disease. He states that his friend at the industrial ammunition factory where he works told him he should “get it looked at.” The patient admits to some nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea over the past year, but he states that he “feels fine now.” On physical examination, the lesion is an erythematous, scaly, ulcerated plaque on the flexor surface of his upper arm. The rest of the exam is within normal limits. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

When the physician asks her if she has taken any medication for her symptoms, she answers, “My husband and I possess great powers to heal sickness. So I tried to cure my symptoms with my power. However, due to some divine cause, it did not work this time, so I thought I should seek medical advice”. Upon asking her husband about this, he says, \"I have always had an immense ability to heal others through my powerful thoughts. It is only after I married her that she came to realize the powers within herself.” The physician examines her and prescribes appropriate medications for her symptoms. A year later, the woman presents again to the same physician with a cough and cold for 2 days. The physician asks her why did she not use her ‘power’ this time. She replies, “I separated from my husband 6 months ago, and I no longer believe that I nor my husband had any special power.” The woman denies any hallucinations, mood disturbances, and socio-occupational impairment to date.

    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to his physician with a chronic cough which he has had for the last five years. He mentions that his cough is usually productive; however, sometimes it is dry. His past medical records show seven episodes of sinusitis over the last two years and two episodes of community acquired pneumonia. He is a non-smoker and there is no history of long-term exposure to passive smoking or other airway irritants. There is no family history of an allergic disorder. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. General examination shows mild clubbing of his fingers and examination of his nasal turbinates reveals nasal polyps. Auscultation of his chest reveals crackles and scattered wheezing bilaterally. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest shows dilated, “tram track” bronchi, predominantly involving upper lung fields.

The man also noticed fluid oozing out of the ulcer, which he has been wiping off with a clean cloth. He has had diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years and hypertension for the past 8 years. His medications include metformin and enalapril, although he tends to not take them as directed. His vital signs are normal. Examination of his left foot reveals a 3 cm x 3 cm ulcer with an irregular border and clear fluid over the base with erythema in the surrounding skin. An image of the lesion is taken and shown below. Laboratory investigations reveal the following:\nCapillary blood glucose (CBG) 340 mg/dL\nHemoglobin (Hb%) 9.8 mg/dL\nWhite blood cell count (WBC) 16,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 34 mm in the 1st hour\nThe physician recommends wound debridement and prescribes an antibiotic for 1 week. The patient is also told to control his blood sugar by taking his medications regularly and paying better attention to his diet. He is also advised to change his dressing daily for the next 7 days. After 1 week, the patient’s ulcer begins to heal. Which of the following best describes the healing process of this patient’s lesion?",

She appears to be in significant distress and is having trouble getting comfortable on the exam table. She and her mother both have a history of calcium oxalate kidney stones. She has a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes and hypertension. She takes metformin, metoprolol and lisinopril. She has been watching her weight and eating a high protein diet that mainly consists of chicken and seafood. She also eats a great deal of yogurt for the calcium. She asks if she should cut out the yogurt, and wonders if it is the cause of her current kidney stone. What lifestyle modification would reduce her risk of developing kidney stones in the future?",

An oropharyngeal examination is suggestive of exudative pharyngitis with a white coat over the tongue. The physician swabs the throat and uses the swab in a rapid antigen detection test kit. He also sends the sample for microbiological culture.

    "question": "A 57-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of decreased urine output. She reports that over the past 2 weeks she has been urinating less and less every day. She denies changes in her diet or fluid intake. The patient has a history of lupus nephritis, which has resulted in end stage renal disease. She underwent a renal transplant 2 months ago. Since then she has been on mycophenolate and cyclosporine, which she takes as prescribed. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 172/102 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 17/min with an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Labs show an elevation in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. On physical examination, she has 2+ pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Urinalysis shows elevated protein. A post-void bladder scan is normal. A renal biopsy is obtained, which shows lymphocyte infiltration and intimal swelling. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",

She reports that the pain is not new and usually starts within half an hour of eating a meal. The pain has been previously diagnosed as biliary colic, and she underwent a cholecystectomy three months ago for symptomatic biliary colic. Her liver reportedly looked normal at that time. The patient dates the onset of these episodes to shortly after she underwent a sleeve gastrectomy several years ago, and the episodes were more severe immediately following that surgery.

Initially, she used to misplace keys and forget her dog's name or her phone number. Now, she often forgets about what she has seen on television or read about the day before. She used to go for a walk every morning but stopped one month ago after she became lost on her way back home. Her son has prevented her from cooking because she has had episodes of leaving the gas stove oven on after making a meal. She becomes agitated when asked questions directly but is unconcerned when her son reports her history and says he is overprotective of her.

    "question": "A mother brings her 7-year-old son to the pediatrician because she is worried about his sleep. She reports that the child has repeatedly woken up in the middle of the night screaming and thrashing. Although she tries to reassure the child, he does not respond to her or acknowledge her presence. Soon after she arrives, he stops screaming and appears confused and lethargic before falling back asleep. When asked about these events, the child reports that he cannot recall ever waking up or having any bad dreams. These events typically occur within four hours of the child going to sleep. The child’s past medical history is notable for asthma and type I diabetes mellitus. He uses albuterol and long-acting insulin. There have been no recent changes in this patient’s medication regimen. His family history is notable for obesity and obstructive sleep apnea in his father. Physical examination reveals a healthy male at the 40th and 45th percentiles for height and weight, respectively.

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with a 5-week history of multiple cutaneous ulcers on his left forearm and neck, which he first noticed after returning from a 2-month stay in rural Peru. He does not recall any trauma or arthropod bites. The lesions began as non-pruritic erythematous papules that became enlarged, ulcerated, and crusted. There is no history of fever or abdominal pain. He has been sexually active with a single partner since their marriage at 24 years of age. The physical examination reveals erythematous, crusted plaques with central ulceration and a raised border. There is no fluctuance, drainage, or sporotrichoid spread. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed an ulcerated lesion with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Amastigotes within dermal macrophages are seen on Giemsa staining. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "question": "A 12-year-old girl presents to the pediatric dermatologist with an expanding, but otherwise asymptomatic erythematous patch on her right shoulder, which she first noticed 3 days ago. The girl states the rash started as a small red bump but has gradually progressed to its current size. No similar lesions were observed elsewhere by her or her mother. She has felt ill and her mother has detected intermittent low-grade fevers. During the skin examination, a target-like erythematous patch, approximately 7 cm in diameter, was noted on the left shoulder (as shown in the image). Another notable finding was axillary lymphadenopathy. On further questioning it was revealed that the patient went camping with her grandfather approximately 11 days ago; however, she does not recall any insect bites or exposure to animals. The family has a pet cat living in their household. Based on the history and physical examination results, what is the most likely diagnosis?",

He has a history of at least 6 previous collapses to the ground with no warning. When these episodes occur, he becomes pale, diaphoretic, and recovers quickly within a few seconds. These episodes always occur when he is standing. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and one myocardial infarction. His medication list includes aspirin, clopidogrel, bisoprolol, metformin, rosuvastatin, and valsartan. Further history reveals that he has constipation, early satiety, and recently lost 2.2 kg (5 lb) of weight. While lying down, his blood pressure is 145/64 mm Hg and the heart rate is 112/min. After 2 minutes of standing, the blood pressure is 120/65 mm Hg and the heart rate is 112/min. A 12-lead ECG showed Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.

    "question": "A 68-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fever, progressive weakness, and cough for the past five days. He experienced a similar episode 2 months ago, for which he was hospitalized for 10 days while visiting his son in Russia. He states that he has never fully recovered from that episode. He felt much better after being treated with antibiotics, but he still coughs often during meals. He sometimes also coughs up undigested food after eating. For the last 5 days, his coughing has become more frequent and productive of yellowish-green sputum. He takes hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and pantoprazole for the retrosternal discomfort that he often experiences while eating. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 30 years and drinks one shot of vodka every day. The patient appears thin. His temperature is 40.1°C (104.2°F), pulse is 118/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Auscultation of the lungs shows right basal crackles. There is dullness on percussion at the right lung base. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.
